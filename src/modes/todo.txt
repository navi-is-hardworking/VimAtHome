issues with folding:
-jump
-most subjects auto open fold really annoying

maybe new quick menu: open commands
goto finder/git/etc
toggle copilot

snapshot location for viewing
remove moving at end/beginning of line moving to next line above/below

calculator

add highlight to anchors again
history
pull from insert mode
when deleting in extend, it keeps a residual selection

move del shift to pull

Fast.. Add selection to custom finder. add to goto menu
fast.. find next in custom finder maybe replace find next match if it exists?

//////

track all instances of last command used.
add a repeat last command key

//////

shift+o should be jump to block
need move to next non empty non-word line below/above would be nice, i can replace the move to next match maybe

/////

when pullng ,
gets stuck in layer 0
can't move because layer 0 but still in command mode, so pull needs to either exit command mode or make sure keyboard is in move mode
best to just restore the previous mode

when move to empty space, check above and below indentation and modify current line to match

/////

for bracketize
- check if line above is not empty
    - if so, assume its the if statement,
    - make sure selected lines are 1 indentation greater than parent line
        - means don't indent if already indented, lower indent if too much, increase indent if too little
    - add bracket to the end of the parent line
    
for selection highlight
- reselecting should remove 

/////

fix jump on line setting last skip to reverse
combine the skip forwards char commands to make faster
make quick select configurable through the settings

issue with closing terminal in editor tab, is that it seems to detect "isTerminalFocus" but responds to "closeEditor"
add when .term session && commandMode

ctrl up + down should move to start of functions instead for line, moving up indent is too unreliable

** make it so go to end of line does not use change to insert first to make it faster
see if i can modify taskbar colors

fix swapping of words wrong bounds when swapping to left
/////

where ever i am, enter should start a forward to first char of that subject that I am on
shift enter vice versa.
inline selected ( selected text ) => 


/////

line first/last object should be move to function below/above
ctrl+up/down should be first/last object in bounding function
new line should not end insert mode

/////

block mode to not select lines that start with / comment symbols like rl
line right should take me to middle of range of function symbol

edit history manager should start recording whenever insert mode is entered. remember last location of that insert mode

sorted selection history
max heap with count of duplicate selections

hashmap to node
maxheap of counts

map{
    Item1{"selection1":2,}
    Item2{"selection2":3,}
}

heap -> {
    Item2,
    Item1
}

///// edit hisotry manager fixes /////

- Only start recording when in insert mode. Being in insert mode, then whenever i make an edit, that location is stored as a line number only
- When storing locations, if the current location is with range +-1 line of another stored edit, that stored edit is removed (as the current will overwrite it)

? How to deal with lines getting deleted?
! When line gets deleted/added, shift all edit locations (lines below) to match accordingly


///////

should changing subject kill the anchor if NOT extending? This could make it so that 

///////

current brackets now jumps lin line 
but it can't iterate vertical because i'm forcing it forwards, also it should be able to jump backwards... so it should check full line first

///////

fixSelection for word mode
- if current selection is not word, check inside current selection (instead of checking outwardly) first

double forward

///////

fix edit history, 
fix collapse to work on multi selection

Fix markers to make them persistant across sessions and, track line syntax so they move with changes

////

rework collapsing selections to be done inside IO
when jumping from line mode, select word at line end first;
